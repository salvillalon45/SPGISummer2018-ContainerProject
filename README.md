# SPGISummer2018-ContainerProject
[SPGI 2018 Summer] - Project: Containers and Web Application Project
- A simple web application that explains what Docker and Containers are. This simple web application was used as a test to run inside a 
Docker Container

# Summary
- During my internship, I was tasked with learning about Containers and how to implement them using Docker

- Throughout the tutorials for Docker, I noticed that they always used Flask to create a web application and use it to run a container. In 
order to understand these tutorials better, I decided to learn Flask

- Based on my learning, I was able to create this.

- I also had to deploy it to the cloud. I used Google App Engine for that.

# Technology
